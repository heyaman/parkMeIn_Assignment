# parkMeIn_Assignment


## . System Requirement
1) Design and implement a multi-storied parking lot system. The system should be able to function in the form of APIs, also runnable from the command line, and should be built in Node JS<br />.
2) The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots<br />.
3) The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses<br />.
4) The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.A motorcycle can park in any spot.A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots<br />.
5) The parking must be filled in a linear fashion i.e user should not be allotted a slot on level 2 if level 1 still has space for his vehicle.The same linear approach should be followed at the same level as well. The allotment should not be random <br />.
6)From the front end, only the vehicle type will be provided and the APIs will return the slot for the vehicle.Also, the system should be able to display the count of each kind of vehicle present at the lot at any point in time.The vehicle slot and type can also be fetched using the registration number and vice-versa.<br />.
